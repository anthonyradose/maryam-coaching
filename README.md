## Overview

Four independently routable marketing pages sharing a single React codebase, TypeScript for type safety, and Tailwind for styling. Each campaign has unique content and booking links, all configured centrally in `src/config/campaigns.tsx`. Google Reviews are pulled dynamically from a WordPress endpoint and displayed in a Swiper carousel. Built with Vite for fast development and production builds targeting Vercel.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthonyradose/maryam-coaching.git
cd maryam-coaching
npm install
```

## Local Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To build all four campaign bundles:

```bash
npm run build
```

`npm run build` runs `tsc -b && vite build` — type-checks then bundles each campaign into `dist/`.

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

This project uses a multi-entry Vite build to generate four independent campaign bundles, each deployed as a separate single-page application. All campaigns deploy together to a single Vercel project, with each campaign corresponding to a unique marketing route.

### Vercel Rewrites

Each campaign has a unique marketing route defined in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { 
      "source": "/conseillere-conjugale-en-ligne", 
      "destination": "/campaign1/index.html" 
    },
    { 
      "source": "/conseillere-conjugale-versailles", 
      "destination": "/campaign2/index.html" 
    },
    { 
      "source": "/ravivez-la-flamme-dans-votre-couple", 
      "destination": "/campaign3/index.html" 
    },
    { 
      "source": "/je-veux-sauver-notre-couple", 
      "destination": "/campaign4/index.html" 
    }
  ]
}
```

To add a new route, add a new rewrite object to the `rewrites` array, set `source` to the marketing URL path and `destination` to the campaign bundle path (`/campaignX/index.html`), then commit and push to trigger auto-deploy.

### Campaign Configuration

All campaign-specific content (booking links, hero text, sections) is centralized in `src/config/campaigns.tsx`:

```typescript
export const campaigns = {
  campaign1: {
    bookingLink: "https://calendly.com/...",
    hero: { title: "...", subtitle: "...", ctaSubtitle: "..." },
    why: { title: "...", paragraphs: [...], bullets: [...] },
    howToFix: { title: "...", description: "..." }
  }
};
```

To update booking links or campaign content, edit the corresponding campaign object in `src/config/campaigns.tsx` and commit and push to trigger auto-deploy.
